# PyBer_Analysis
### Overview
##### The purpose of this project was to analyze rideshare data from January to early May of 2019 comprised of fare cost, type of cities, and drivers in each city.

### Results
##### Based on the weekly fare cost, rural city types are the lowest priced when compared to Suburban and Urban city types. Rural areas have shown to be consistent in price each week, less than $500, with a slight decrease leading in April. Suburban areas have been consistently at $1000 up until April. April, suburban areas increased to almost $1,500 each week in fare cost. Urban areas have increased and decreased cost week by week during the months of March and April (twice the amount).

##### Max. cost for Urban areas was $2,500 while the min was close to $1,600. Suburban areas have had the highest cost of weekly fare increase in April.

#### Summary
##### I recommend reducing the amount of total drivers in the Urban area in order to better increase the amount of fare per driver that they take home. To have more drivers than total rides in a city, seems that the business is not there for that many drivers.
